# 🛒 Online Shop - ASP.NET Core MVC + Vue.js

## 📌 Description  
This is a full-featured **Online Shop** built using **ASP.NET Core Razor Pages** with a **layered architecture** for better separation of concerns. The front-end is powered by **Vue.js** with **Axios** for API requests, and the UI is styled using **Bulma**. The cart is managed using **session storage**, and payments are securely handled via **Stripe**. Authentication uses **Claims-based Authorization**, and **FluentValidation** ensures data integrity.
